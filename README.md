# fcrn_paddle
## Introduction
This repo is a re-implementation of paper [Deeper Depth Prediction with Fully Convolutional Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00373) using [paddle_paddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/) deep learning frame.
## Schedule
- [x] Read the paper and run the author's implementation.
- [x] Coding(with paddle_paddle)...
- [x] Run with no bug!
- [ ] Train and fine-tune till reaching the metrics in the original paper.
The project have not been trained compeletely due to the limitation of computational resources. 
## How to Use?
1. Download the database from [NYU Depth Dataset V2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html#raw_parts).
2. Clone the repo.
3. You can train the model from begining, or you can also continue to train my model. You can get my model from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10dxyXk3JQc8gw1drpuDBtQ) with passward 'frvo'.
